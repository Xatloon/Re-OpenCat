basic implementation of the Quicksort algorithm in Rust:

```rust
fn quicksort(arr: &mut [i32]) {
    if arr.len() > 1 {
        let pivot = arr[arr.len() / 2];
        let mut left = 0;
        let mut right = arr.len() - 1;

        while left <= right {
            while arr[left] < pivot { left += 1; }
            while arr[right] > pivot { right -= 1; }

            if left <= right {
                arr.swap(left, right);
                left += 1;
                right -= 1;
            }
        }

        quicksort(&mut arr[0..right+1]);
        quicksort(&mut arr[left..]);
    }
}
```

This implementation takes a mutable slice of `i32` integers and uses the `arr.len()` function to get the length of the slice. If the length is greater than 1, the function proceeds to choose the pivot value as the element in the middle of the slice. Then, it initializes `left` and `right` variables to the beginning and end of the slice, respectively. The while loop runs until the `left` and `right` pointers meet.

Within the loop, the function finds the first element from the left side that is greater than or equal to the pivot value, and the first element from the right side that is less than or equal to the pivot value. If those elements are not in the correct order, the function swaps them.

After the while loop ends, the function recursively calls itself on the two sub-slices to the left and right of the current pivot position.

Overall, this implementation is not the most optimal way to implement quicksort in Rust, but it should give you a good starting point for writing your own algorithms.
